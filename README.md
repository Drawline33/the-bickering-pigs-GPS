# the-bickering-pigs-GPS-V1
This is a GY-NEO7MV2 NEO-7M GPS Module with Arduino Mega 2560 and a 3.5 inch tft screen shield with onboard SD card read/write.

Items in this project include
Arduino Mega Prototype Sheild v3
Arduino Mega2560 Arduino Board
3.5 inch tft screen shild with sd reader (not sure the brand i bough on amazon and it fit Arduino Uno and Mega

I am using a proto type shield for connection to Arduino Mega 2560 with some modification I added side connection to last pins on the shild to allow more access to pins with screen on. 

Using this repo you can get a test on the gps printing to 3.5inch tft screen and serial read as well. If
the serail port is not showing on baud 57600 you may need to change it on arduino serial monitoring window to 9600 and then chang back to the 
57600 baud it should reset screen and gps to start showing on both serial and screen after he reset.

If anyone has anything to add please let me know I plan to add sd logging and maybe a better UI to this project in he near future!!
