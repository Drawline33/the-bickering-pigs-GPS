# the-bickering-pigs-GPS-V1
This is a neo 7g v2 gps module with arduino mega 2560 and a 3.5 inch touch screen and cord read/write shield 



Using this repo you can get a test on the gps printing to 3.5inch tft screen and serial read as well. If
the serail port is not showing on baud 57600 you may need to change it to 9600 and then chang back to the 
57600 baud it should reset screen and gps to start showing on both serial and screen after he reset.

If anyone has anything to add please let me know I plan to add sd logging and maybe a better UI to this project in he near future!!
